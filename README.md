# Long Request Notifier

Receive sound when long-running web requests complete in inactive tabs. Stop checking back â€“ get notified!

**Features:**

*   **Inactive Tab Focus:** Notifications only for background tabs.
*   **Custom Duration Threshold:** Define what "long" means for you (in seconds).
*   **Domain Filtering (for Request Destinations):** Monitor all, whitelist specific *request destination domains*, or blacklist them to ignore. Filters apply to the domain a network request is *sent to* (e.g., an API endpoint), not the website you are currently viewing.
*   **Sound Control:** Upload custom sounds (MP3/OGG/WAV/M4A, max 1MB), adjust volume, test.
*   **OS Desktop Notifications:** Optional system-level alerts showing the completed request's hostname and duration.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** English, German, Spanish, Simplified Chinese.

Ideal for developers tracking API calls, users with slow uploads/downloads, or anyone multitasking with lengthy background web processes.
